Website for Michael and Liz


TODO:
1) On the "Wedding.html" page remove the red lines from header and footer and make them html elements.
2) On the "Wedding.html" page change the graphics for the left sidebar. Either choose a web font or stick with the images but make them transparent and just let the background color show through. Font would be ideal.
3) Refactor the code on "index.html" to use the pure.css grid system correctly. (Remove all styles from html and put in css, etc.)
4) Figure out what to do with the images... for sure reduce resolution.
5) Use responsive elements? maybe...
